**Questions**
# First
You are making a program for a bus service. 
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. 
Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.
**Thanks to @virtualwiz1 for making concept clear**

# Second
You need to make a countdown app.
Given a number N as input, output numbers from N to 1 on separate lines. 
Also, when the current countdown number is a multiple of 5, the app should output "Beep".

# Third

You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10. 
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.
