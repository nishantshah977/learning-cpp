# First
You are making a program for a bus service. 
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. 
Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.
Thanks to @virtualwiz1 for making concept clear

You need to make a countdown app.
Given a number N as input, output numbers from N to 1 on separate lines. 
Also, when the current countdown number is a multiple of 5, the app should output "Beep".
