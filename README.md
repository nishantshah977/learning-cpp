**Questions**
# First
You are making a program for a bus service. 
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. 
Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.
**Thanks to @virtualwiz1 for making concept clear**

# Second
You need to make a countdown app.
Given a number N as input, output numbers from N to 1 on separate lines. 
Also, when the current countdown number is a multiple of 5, the app should output "Beep".

# Third
You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10. 
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.
**Thanks to @virtualwiz1 for teaching "how to write this program using loop".**

# Fourth
You must set a PIN for your suitcase that contains 4 digits in the range of 0 to N.
Write a program to take the N number as input, generate 4 random numbers from the range and print them sequentially, without spaces.

# Fifth
While playing a board game, you and your friend roll the dice and the person who rolled the higher number moves forward.
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the higher number of the two. Print the result.
If numbers are equal function must return that number.

# Sixth 
Pastry chefs are competing to win the battle of the cakes. For each additional cake made, the number of eggs required increases by 1 (1 egg for the first cake, 2 eggs for the second, etc.). 
Take the number of cakes that must be baked as the input, calculate (recursively) how many eggs were used to bake them by the end of the battle and output the result.

# Seventh 
A palindromic number is a number (such as 626) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Write a function that returns true if a given number is a palindrome, and false, if it is not.
Complete the given function, so that the code in main works and results in the expected output.
